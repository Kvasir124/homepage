The site maintains basic reactivity and handles small screens well. Besides changing the site's theme, it isn't interactive in any way. When the theme button is pressed, alternate classes with changed color values are toggled for specific HTML elements. An if/else statement is used to determine whether these HTML elements contain the alternate classes. Based on the result, the text inside the button changes to fit the current theme.
